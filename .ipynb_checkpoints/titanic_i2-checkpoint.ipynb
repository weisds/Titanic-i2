    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This kernel was created for the purpose of defining the best features and models for the Kaggle Titanic dataset that together yeilds the best prediction score. This kernel contains details around the analysis and experiment undertaken in the effort to derive the best feature and model set. In addition, the causation effect on the predition result of each engineered feature as an individual addition to the original feature set, various combinations derived from feature selection technique, and finally all together as a batch to the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "We are attempting create a ML model that provides a binary result indicating rather or not a passenger on the Titanic will surive the well-known desaster. (review this with the description of the competition). This kernel contains the detail breakdown of the analysis and experiments attempted in the effort to achieve the highest percision. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps taken are grouped into two major iterations: iteration 1 where we conducted the EDA, Feature Engineering and the attempts to build the most accurate model with the findings; iteration 2, sought to build upon the effort from iteration 1 by validating the causation effect of each engineered feature on the predition result to determine best feature set for training the model. In addition, we also attempted a couple new feature engineering technique in iteration 2, namely, interation and normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "Revealed by our post-submission analysis, we see that Sex, Title and Pclass_Sex_Embarked are the top three features which have the most positive effect on the surival rate, and we don't see any strong trend on features that have a negative impact on the result. Conculding from our Permutation Importance analysis and Shap analysis, we can predict with a level of certainty that a female passenger where PClass is 1 and is onborading from Southampton will have a better chance of suriving the accident. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling and Data Preperation\n",
    "From our Iteration 1 effort, we can conclude that blindly creating new features based on corrolations and dropping or keeping the raw features without knowing the subsequent impacts will let to results that are difficult to interpret hard to improve on.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hands, from Iteration 2, we noticed that results from baseline model evalution on features do not always hold true in the final modeling. Specifically, we see that measures that resulted in positive impact on the model accuracy based on our baseline model evaluation, when aggregated did not lead to a stacked improve as anticipated. Instead, we observed a much lower accuracy score when combining these measures. As a result, we propose that when doing future modeling, all features should be kept, and use feature selection technique to generate the best dataset, and we should test different feature combinations for optimal result.\n",

    "## Iteration 1\n",
    "In this iteration of the experiment, we are going to do EDA to understand the data in the aspects of outliers, holes, size of the data, continuous to discrete data, categorical data, numeric data vs string data, skewed data, etc. Next, based on the findings we will clean the data, then apply feature engineering techniques to convert string to numeric values, engineer new features and impute categorical data to prepare for the modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the modeling stage, we still attempt multiple models and compare the results, for scoring we will use cross_val to determine the accuracy of the resulting models. After we have a set of model candidates, we will also attempt the ensemble approach to create models using the top five models resulting for the model evaluation effort.\n",

    "Lastly, we will productionize our effort by creating functions to streamline the data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling process.\n",

    "In this effort, we will first build a collection of base models with a set of base scores. Then, we are going perform hyperparameter optimization using Grid Search to find the best parameter combination for each model to find the top five tuned models for the final prediction. In addition, we will take an ensemble approach taking all the tuned model and combine them with VotingClassifier to create an aggregated model that we are also going to use for the final prediction."

    "To understand what factors contribute to the survival rate in the Titanic event and their respective weight on the result, we ran PermutationImportance and generated a Shap value table for all feature with the best model observed in our Iteration 2 effort. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the PermutationImportance table we immediately see that Sex, Title and Pclass_Sex_Embarked are the top three features which have the most positive effect on the surival rate. On the other hands, we don't see too many features that contribute to the negative side of the surival rate. We evaluate this with our Shap chart and see the result being relatively consistent with the ranking we see in the PermutationImportance table with strong clustering, meaning that the conclusion we drew from the PermutationImportance table represents the norm of the data.\n",

    "Finally, we can say with confident that a passenger who is a female, in first class, and onboraded from Southampton has the best chance of suriving the Titanic disaster."
